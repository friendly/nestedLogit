Description: Provides functions for specifying and fitting nested dichotomy logistic regression models
     for a multi-category response and methods for summarising those models.
     Nested dichotomies are statistically independent, and hence provide an
     additive decomposition of tests for the overall 'polytomous' response.
     When the dichotomies make sense substantively, this method can be a simpler alternative 
     to the standard 'multinomial' logistic model which compares response categories to a reference level.
