# nestedLogit <img src="man/figures/logo.png" style="float:right; height:200px;" />

The `nestedLogit` package provides functions for fitting nested dichotomy logistic regression models
for a polytomous response. Nested dichotomies are statistically independent, and hence provide an
additive decomposition of tests for the overall polytomous response.

## Installation

This package has not yet been submited to CRAN.
This development version can be installed to your R library directly from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/friendly/nestedLogit) via:

     if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
     remotes::install_github("friendly/nestedLogit", build_vignettes = TRUE)



## Package overview

The package provides one main function, `nestedLogit()` for fitting the set of $(m-1)$
binary logistic regression models for a polytomous response with $m$ levels.
These can be specified using helper functions,

* `dichotomy()`: constructs a _single_ dichotomy among the levels of a response factor;
* `logits()`: creates the set of dichotomies, typically using `dichotomy()` for each.
* `continuationLogits()`: provides a convenient way to generate all dichotomies for an ordered response.

There are methods including `as.matrix.dichotomies()`, `as.character.dichotomies()`
to facilitate working with `dichotomies` objects in other representations.

The result of `nestedLogit()` is an object of class `nested`. It contains
the set of $(m-1)$ `glm()` models fit to the dichotomies, ...

### Methods


As befits a model-fitting function, the package defines a nearly complete set of methods for class `nested` objects:

* `print()`, `summary()`
* `update()` re-fits a model, allowing changes in the model `formula`, `data`, `subset`, and `contrasts`.
* `coef()` returns the coefficients for the predictors in each dichotomy
* `vcov()` returns the variance-covariance matrix of the predictors
* `anova()` provides ANOVA Type I (sequential) tests for each dichotomy and for the combined model. When given a sequence of objects, `anova()` tests the models against one another in the order specified.
* `Anova()` uses `car::Anova()` to provide ANOVA Type II (partial) tests for each dichotomy and for the combined model.
* `predict()` obtains predicted probabilities for the response categories, useful for producing plots to aid interpretation.
* `glance()`, `tidy()` are extensions of `broom::glance.glm()` and `broom::tidy.glm()` to obtain compact summaries of a `nested` model object`.

## Examples

This example uses data on women's labor force participation to fit a nested logit model for
the response, `partic`, representing categories
`not.work`, `parttime` and `fulltime for 263 women from a 1977
survey in Canada. This dataset is explored in more detail in the
package vignette, `vignette("nestedLogits", package = "nestedLogit")`.

A model for the complete polytomy can be specified as two nested
dichotomies, using helper functions `dichotomy()` and `logits()`:

* `work`: {not.work} vs. {parttime, fulltime}
* `full`: {parttime} vs. {fulltime}, but only for those working

`nestedLogit()` effectively fits each of these dichotomies
as logistic regression models via `glm(..., family = binomial)`

```{r wlf-model}
data(Womenlf, package = "carData")

# Use `logits()` and `dichotomy()` to specify the comparisons of interest
comparisons <- logits(work=dichotomy("not.work", c("parttime", "fulltime")),
                      full=dichotomy("parttime", "fulltime"))

m <- nestedLogit(partic ~ hincome + children,
                 dichotomies = comparisons,
                 data=Womenlf)
coef(m)

names(m)
```

`Anova()` produces analysis of variance deviance tests for the terms in this model for each of the submodels, as well as for the combined responses of the polytomy.


```{r wlf-anova}

names(m$models)

car::Anova(m)
```
<!-- A basic plot of predicted probabilities can be produced using -->
<!-- the `plot()` method for `"nested"` objects. -->
<!-- ```{r wlf-plot} -->
<!-- #| out.width = "100%" -->
<!-- op <- par(mfcol=c(1, 2), mar=c(4, 4, 3, 1) + 0.1) -->
<!-- plot(m, "hincome", list(children="absent"),  -->
<!--      xlab="Husband's Income", legend=FALSE) -->
<!-- plot(m, "hincome", list(children="present"),  -->
<!--      xlab="Husband's Income") -->
<!-- ``` -->
