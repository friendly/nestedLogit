As befits a model-fitting function, the package defines a nearly complete set of methods for class `nestedLogit` objects:

* `print()`, `summary()`: prints the results for each of the submodels
* `update()` re-fits a model, allowing changes in the model `formula`, `data`, `subset`, and `contrasts`.
* `coef()` returns the coefficients for the predictors in each dichotomy
* `vcov()` returns the variance-covariance matrix of the predictors
* `anova()` provides ANOVA Type I (sequential) tests for each dichotomy and for the combined model. When given a sequence of objects, anova tests the models against one another in the order specified.
* `Anova()` uses `car::Anova()` to provide ANOVA Type II (partial) tests for each dichotomy and for the combined model.
* `anova()` provides ANOVA analysis of deviance tables for one or more fitted model objects.
* `linearHypothesis()` gives Wald tests for hypotheses about coefficients or their linear combinations
* `predict()` obtains predicted probabilities for the response categories, useful for producing plots to aid interpretation.
* `glance()`, `tidy()` are extensions of `broom::glance.glm()` and `broom::tidy.glm()` to obtain compact summaries of a `nestedLogit` model object`.
* `plot()` provides basic plots of the predicted probabilities over a range of values of the predictor variables.
